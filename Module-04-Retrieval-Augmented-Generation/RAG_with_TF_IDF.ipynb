And there is nothing to stop the development of new sources of generation. In fact, the only way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is to use less fossil fuels. This is the most important thing to do. It is also the least expensive. If we could reduce our carbon emissions by a factor of 10, we would reduce emissions of about one-third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. We would also reduce greenhouse gases by about half of what we are currently emitting. That is a huge reduction in emissions, but it is not a major one. So, if we can reduce carbon pollution by 10 percent, that is an enormous reduction. But if you look at the other side of that equation, it's not that big a deal. You can get a lot of emissions reductions by reducing the use of fossil fuel. For example, in a country like China, where we have a very low carbon footprint, you can cut emissions from coal by 20 percent. A country that has a high carbon profile, like India, can do that\n",
