# Generators in Python
## 1. What is a Generator?
A generator in Python is a function that yields values instead of returning them all at once. Unlike regular functions, which return a single value and terminate, a generator can pause execution and resume from where it left off.
## 2. The yield Keyword
The yield keyword is used to return values from a generator function without losing its state. Unlike return, yield remembers where the function left off and resumes execution from that point the next time it is called.
