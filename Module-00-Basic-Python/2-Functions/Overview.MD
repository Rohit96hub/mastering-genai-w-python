# Python Functions: An Overview

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions allow us to reuse code, making it cleaner and more efficient.

## Defining a Function

To define a function in Python, we use the `def` keyword followed by the function's name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`. Inside the parentheses, we can specify parameters (inputs the function can accept). The function's code should be indented.

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple function:

#### Example:
```python
def greet():
    print("Welcome to Python programming!")
```

This function greet doesn't take any arguments and simply prints a greeting. To use this function, call its name followed by parentheses:

```python
greet()
```
#### Output:
```
Welcome to Python programming!
```
