Whatâ€™s happening under the hood? When you ask a question:

- The client sends your question to Claude

- Claude analyzes the available tools and decides which one(s) to use

- The client executes the chosen tool(s) through the MCP server

- The results are sent back to Claude

- Claude formulates a natural language response

- The response is displayed to you!
