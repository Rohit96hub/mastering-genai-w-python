Techniques Used:

- Neural Networks (Feedforward)

Activation functions

- Model training and evaluation

Libraries: 
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 2. 🏠 House Price Prediction – Single Variable

Notebook: House_Price_Prediction_LR.ipynb

Goal: Predict house prices based on a single feature (e.g., size in sqft).

Dataset: train.csv

Techniques Used:

Simple Linear Regression

Data visualization with Matplotlib

Evaluation using Mean Squared Error

3. 🏘 House Price Prediction – Multiple Variables
Notebook: House_Price_Prediction_Multiple_Variable_LR.ipynb

Goal: Predict house prices using multiple features (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location, etc.)

Techniques Used:

Multivariable Linear Regression

Data preprocessing with Pandas

Model training and performance evaluation  
### 📁 Dataset
train.csv contains the data used for house price prediction notebooks. Ensure the file is in the same directory as the notebooks for seamless execution.
