# ⚙️ Key Components of LLMOps

This section outlines the core building blocks of operationalizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Each component plays a vital role in building scalable, safe, and effective LLM-based systems.

| **Component**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model Selection**   | Choose between open-source (e.g., LLaMA, Falcon) and closed-source (GPT-4, Claude) models based on use-case, cost, and flexibility. |
| **Prompt Engineering**| Design prompts strategically using prompt templates, few-shot, zero-shot, or chain-of-thought approaches for consistent, high-quality results. |
| **Evaluation**        | Evaluate outputs for accuracy, coherence, and minimize hallucinations. Use both automated and human-in-the-loop metrics. |
| **Fine-tuning**       | Adapt base models with LoRA, PEFT, or full fine-tuning. Use RLHF for reward-based tuning with human feedback. |
| **Deployment**        | Deploy LLM apps via REST APIs, LangServe, LlamaIndex, FastAPI, or other frameworks for scalable access. |
| **Monitoring**        | Track performance with metrics such as latency, token usage, cost, response quality, and distribution drift. |
| **Feedback Loops**    | Implement real-time feedback using tools like LangSmith, PromptLayer, and manual corrections to improve model outputs over time. |
